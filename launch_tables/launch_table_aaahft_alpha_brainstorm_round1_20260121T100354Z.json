  "batch_goal_summary": "Diverse, from-scratch alpha brainstorming batch for AAAHFT ES (CME) TBBO research. Objective: generate many concrete, testable hypotheses for high-frequency scalping and market making without relying on the literature-derived Alpha Bank, to maximize idea diversity and avoid convergence on the same mechanisms. Each agent must respect binding constraints: no lookahead (use `ts_recv` as the visibility clock), 1ms one-way latency from signal to CME order update effective time, and $0.58 per side costs ($1.16 round trip) for both maker and taker. Data is TBBO-only (top-of-book + trade print fields), so any hypothesis requiring full depth, hidden liquidity, or true queue position must be marked infeasible or expressed as a TBBO-feasible proxy with caveats. Agents should cover both market-order/taker and limit-order/maker styles, including price-action style pattern logic (e.g., Brooks-like concepts translated to micro time/event/range bars), classic indicator-based scalping automation adapted to microstructure, and robust regime filters/stop logic designed to survive spread widening and volatility spikes. Deliverables must be written to disk as YAML hypotheses with explicit parameter sweeps, diagnostics (heatmaps/plateaus, failure-mode slices, event traces), and cost-feasibility reasoning. No heavy coding; produce research artifacts only.",
