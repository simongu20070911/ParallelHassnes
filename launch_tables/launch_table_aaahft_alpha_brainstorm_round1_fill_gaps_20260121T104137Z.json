  "batch_goal_summary": "Gap-fill brainstorming batch for AAAHFT ES (CME) TBBO scalping ideation. The prior brainstorm round produced 10 complete theme packs under `research/alpha_ideation/round1_20260121T100354Z/` but the `09_vol_regime_spread_depth` and `10_microstructure_misc` themes did not get written because their Codex attempts became orphaned (network/stream disconnect). Objective: regenerate ONLY the missing two theme artifacts (one markdown note + one YAML hypothesis list per theme), with the same rigor as the completed themes. Binding constraints: no-lookahead using `ts_recv` as the visibility clock, order updates effective at `signal_ts + 1ms`, costs $0.58 per side ($1.16 round trip) for maker and taker, and TBBO-only data (top-of-book + trade prints; no true queue position). Agents must NOT use or read the literature Alpha Bank (`research/alpha_bank/`) or literature notes (`research/literature/`) to keep this brainstorm diverse. Deliverables must be written to disk in the exact target filenames, contain 18 specific hypotheses each, include explicit parameter sweeps and failure-mode segmentation, and keep cost-feasibility reasoning front and center.",
