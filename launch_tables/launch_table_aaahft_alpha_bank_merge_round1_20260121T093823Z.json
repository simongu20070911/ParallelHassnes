  "batch_goal_summary": "Alpha Bank integration pass for AAAHFT ES (CME) TBBO research. This batch assumes prior literature agents have already produced `research/alpha_bank/raw_hypotheses_*.yaml` and supporting notes under `research/literature/`. Goal: consolidate these raw hypotheses into a single canonical, auditable Alpha Bank: a machine-readable `research/alpha_bank/alpha_bank.yaml` and a human index `research/alpha_bank/ALPHA_BANK.md`. The merge must be conservative (avoid over-merging), preserve provenance (source ids + source files), and enforce binding constraints: no-lookahead (use `ts_recv` as the visibility clock), 1ms one-way latency from signal to CME order update effective time, and $0.58/side fees ($1.16 round trip) for both maker and taker. Because our research data is TBBO-only, any hypothesis that relies on full depth, true queue position, hidden liquidity, or otherwise unobservable states must be labeled as `infeasible` or `proxy` with explicit caveats. The canonical bank must add priority/triage fields (priority 1–5, expected trade frequency, feasibility) and include a concrete test plan per hypothesis: parameter sweep planes (for heatmaps/plateaus), failure-mode segmentation slices (time-of-day, volatility regime, spread widening, depth thinning), and trace-style diagnostics for best/worst cases. This batch also runs an adversarial audit to surface lookahead traps, execution optimism, and sweep multiplicity risks, then proposes the next receding-horizon portfolio (70% exploitation, 20% exploration, 10% replication/audit) optimized for high trades/day while keeping statistical honesty. All deliverables must be written to disk as durable artifacts; do not store full-paper plaintext or large excerpts.",
