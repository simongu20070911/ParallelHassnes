This batch is solely to validate infrastructure correctness: queue ingest, scheduling, runner invocation, event capture, and writing of final.txt/final.json/handoff.json. Requirements: (1) web_search must execute successfully inside the agent run when enabled; (2) the agent must complete a turn and emit schema-conformant Run Report JSON (schema_version 1.0.0); (3) the harness must write final.txt, final.json, and handoff.json into the attempt directory; (4) the attempt must terminalize (succeeded/failed/needs_attention) and update current.json accordingly; (5) the tick loop must not wedge even when the runs store contains historical large batches and previously unreadable paths. The agent task is minimal: locate the official Federal Reserve H.4.1 release page and return the URL in the summary. Workspace mode is shared to avoid disk bloat. Success is mechanical: artifacts exist and are readable from disk without manual intervention. Failure is defined as stalling at the web_search tool request, missing artifacts, or a non-terminal attempt state.",
