  "batch_goal_summary": "Build an as-traded data spec for structural, tradable liquidity-plumbing alpha research in US rates. The non-negotiable constraint is: no approximation on the data pipeline. For each required series we must (1) define observation semantics precisely (what timestamp/date the value refers to), (2) obtain exact public release timestamps (time-of-day + timezone + holiday/early-close exceptions) from primary sources rather than relying on FRED ingestion timing, and (3) confirm real-time vintage availability (values as known then) via ALFRED or an alternative archive, including revision/correction policy. Output must be machine-actionable: each agent provides a narrative plus a machine-readable SeriesSpec YAML block and at least three test cases with concrete timestamps. We assume a conservative tradability standard: if a release occurs on trading day D, the signal_day is D and the earliest tradable entry is the next trading day (enter at close of D+1 for daily-close backtests). Literature agents gather papers/notes about TGA/RRP/reserves/repo plumbing and explicitly extract timing assumptions and identification strategies. A verifier independently re-derives timing for the highest-leverage series to catch subtle errors. This batch is read-only with web research enabled; it should produce artifacts suitable for later integration into code and for preventing false alpha from lookahead or timestamp mistakes.",
