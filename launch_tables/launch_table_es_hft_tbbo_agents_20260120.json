  "batch_goal_summary": "Build a high-quality starting point for ES (CME) intraday/HFT alpha research using Databento GLBX.MDP3 TBBO data already present under ES_CME. Constraints are explicit: fee is $0.58 per side ($1.16 round trip), target is many round trips/day while keeping statistically defensible net-of-costs EV, and latency from signal to CME order update is assumed ~1ms one-way. The immediate objective is to generate concrete, testable hypotheses and an implementable offline research harness spec that respects what TBBO can and cannot support. Each agent produces an actionable deliverable: (1) data inventory + TBBO-derived feature candidates, (2) execution/simulator design under TBBO limitations, (3) specific scalping hypotheses suitable for high trade counts, (4) evaluation methodology for robustness and plateau-finding, (5) posterior-log schema for meta-experiment tracking and Bayesian updating, (6) regime/adaptation ideas that avoid overfitting, and (7) engineering setup guidance for Rust sims and remote execution. Outputs must be immediately useful to start coding the pipeline and running experiments across the 26 day-files, while keeping manual inspection hooks (heatmaps, failure modes, event traces) front and center.",
